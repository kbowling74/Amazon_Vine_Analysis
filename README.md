## Amazon Vine Analysis

### Overview
This analysis was conducted for SellBy, a company that provides products to Amazon Vine members
who use and post reviews for products. The objective is to determine whether there is a bias towards positive reviews by the Amazon Vine members as they recieve compensation for publishing their reviews. 
The dataset used for this analysis was based on pet products reviews from Vine and non-Vine members. 

### Results
- The original dataset was filtered for only reviews that were deemed "helpful" by having a minimum of 20 votes and at least 50% of those votes were marked as helpful. This resulted in a total of 38,010 reviews with Vine reviews accounting for 170 while non-Vine reviews had 37,840. <br><br>

### Summary
Given the results of the analysis showing that Vine members only gave 5 star reviews 38.24% of the time compared to non-Vine members doing so 54.47% of the time, it is fair to say there is not a bias towards positve reviews by Vine members. 

To further understand if there is any bias in reviews given by vine members a similar analysis could be done to look at the frequency of one star reviews to determine if there is a bias towards neagtive reviews. This would require getting the number of 1 star reviews and calculating the percentage of 1 star reviews compared to the total for both Vine and non-Vine reviews.
